# LipReadingApp
This repository contains an application developed using the LipNet model for lip reading. The LipNet model is a deep learning-based approach that leverages convolutional and recurrent neural networks to recognize words from videos of lip movements.

## Features
**Real-time lip reading**: The application utilizes the webcam to capture video input in real-time and performs lip reading on the captured frames.
**LipNet integration**: The LipNet model is integrated into the application, allowing accurate recognition of words based on lip movements.
**Graphical user interface**: The application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the lip reading functionality.
**Customization options**: Users can adjust various parameters such as confidence threshold, language model, and visualizations to enhance the lip reading experience.
**Results display**: The application displays the recognized words along with corresponding confidence scores, providing immediate feedback to the user.
